This repository contains: 
* code that allows to expose different harmonized datasets useful for different applications.
Such datasets are exposed through the [FIWARE NGSI version 2](http://fiware.github.io/context.Orion/api/v2/) API (query).
* documentation on harmonized datamodels for smart cities, developed jointly with [OASC](http://oascities.org), and other domains. 

This work is aligned with the results of the
[GSMA IoT Big Data Ecosystem](http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/iot-big-data/) Project.
Such project is working on the harmonization of APIs and data models for fueling IoT and Big Data Ecosystems. In fact the FIWARE datamodels are a superset of the [GSMA Data Models](http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CLP.26-v1.0.pdf).
